# E-Commerce Product Data Pipeline

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the development of a modern **data engineering pipeline** designed to collect, process, and organize product data from an **e-commerce marketplace**. The pipeline automates the extraction of key product attributes such as product name, original price, discounted price, discount rate, sales volume, and rating.  

The collected data flows through a structured **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** to ensure data quality, scalability, and analytical readiness. This project showcases the implementation of real-world data engineering principles for e-commerce analytics and monitoring use cases.

## Objective  
The objective of this project is to design and implement a **robust and maintainable data pipeline** capable of:  
1. Extracting and storing e-commerce product information from online marketplaces.  
2. Cleaning, validating, and transforming raw data into structured, analytics-ready layers.  
3. Providing a consistent data foundation for insights such as price monitoring, discount analysis, and sales performance tracking.  

This project highlights the end-to-end lifecycle of data engineering — from raw extraction to curated analytics.

## Workflow and Architecture  
The pipeline adopts the **Medallion Architecture** framework, consisting of three layers:

### 1. Bronze Layer – Raw Data Storage  
- Collects raw product data through web scraping or API extraction.  
- Stores unprocessed data in a semi-structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) along with metadata such as extraction time and source URL.  

### 2. Silver Layer – Data Cleaning and Transformation  
- Cleans and standardizes raw data, fixing inconsistencies and formatting issues.  
- Converts text-based prices to numeric values and removes duplicates.  
- Adds enriched attributes such as discount percentage and normalized rating.  

### 3. Gold Layer – Curated Data for Analysis  
- Aggregates and prepares data for analytical use.  
- Enables insights such as top-selling products, pricing trends, and rating distributions.  
- Serves as a trusted data source for dashboards and reporting tools.  

**Data Flow Summary:**  
`Marketplace → Data Scraper/API → Bronze (Raw) → Silver (Cleaned) → Gold (Curated) → BI Dashboard`

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Collection:** Requests, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, PySpark (optional for scalability)  
- **Storage:** Local filesystem or cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3)  
- **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow or Prefect  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or DuckDB  
- **Visualization (optional):** Power BI or Looker Studio

## Future Improvement  
- **Incremental Extraction:** Implement delta scraping or change data capture to update only modified records.  
- **API Integration:** Replace scraping with official API endpoints for stability and compliance.  
- **Data Validation Framework:** Add automated data quality and schema validation checks.  
- **Real-time Processing:** Integrate streaming components for near real-time product monitoring.  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Extend the curated data layer with ML models to forecast price drops or sales performance.
